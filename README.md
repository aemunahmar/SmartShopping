# SmartShopping
Smart Shopping was a simple website we previously created for the compilation of different clothing products from different brands all in one place. The main objective of this website was to make the searching, viewing, and selection of products was easy through simple interaction. Our goal for this project was to make the user’s experience as convenient as possible by allowing them to browse for products from different brands all in one place. A key feature to achieve that goal was the search bar. Although our website had one already, it wasn’t a workable search bar in the traditional sense. The way the previous search bar functioned was only by brand so if you searched the name of a brand featured on the site, it would redirect you to that brand’s page. For this project we wanted to expand on that feature and make it workable by allowing the users to actually search for items that they want to find. The main emphasis of this project lies in providing a user friendly search website for effectively showing the desired results using the new and improved search bar.
